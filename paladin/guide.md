## LEVELING GUIDE (1-50)

### Critical Early Game Info

**THE #1 MISTAKE:** Spamming Blessed Hammer without using your Basic Skill

Faith (your resource) comes from:
- **Advance** (Basic Skill) - Your PRIMARY Faith generator
- **Rally** (after level 12) - Burst Faith + Movement Speed
- Slow passive regeneration

### Level Breakpoints

| Level | Unlock | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Advance | Your Faith generator - USE THIS |
| 2 | Blessed Hammer | Core damage ability |
| 4 | Disciple's Halo | Hammers follow you (huge QoL) |
| 12 | Rally | Emergency Faith + speed burst |
| 15 | **Oath Unlocks** | Pick DISCIPLE immediately |
| 15 | Falling Star | Mobility + Arbiter trigger |
| 22 | Flash of the Blade | Advance becomes Disciple cooldown |
| 34 | **Exaltation** | KEY PASSIVE - major damage spike |
| 50+ | Castle Board | Armor = Damage scaling |

### Skill Bar By Level

#### Levels 1-11
| Slot | Skill | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Basic | **Advance** | SPAM for Faith (2-3 hits between Hammers) |
| Core | Blessed Hammer | Damage |
| 1 | Defiance Aura | Keep active for healing |
| 2 | (empty) | |
| 3 | (empty) | |
| 4 | (empty) | |

#### Levels 12-21
| Slot | Skill | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Basic | **Advance** | Still your main Faith source |
| Core | Blessed Hammer | Damage |
| 1 | Rally | Emergency Faith + Speed |
| 2 | Falling Star | Gap close (unlocks at 15) |
| 3 | Defiance Aura | Sustain |
| 4 | Condemn | Group enemies (unlocks at 18) |

#### Levels 22-34
| Slot | Skill | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Basic | **Advance** | Now also triggers Arbiter via Flash of the Blade |
| Core | Blessed Hammer | Damage |
| 1 | Rally | Faith + Speed |
| 2 | Falling Star | Arbiter trigger |
| 3 | Condemn | Vulnerable + grouping |
| 4 | Defiance Aura | Sustain |

#### Level 34+ (Endgame Transition)
| Slot | Skill | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Basic | Rally | Now primary (Words of Sacrifice gives infinite uses) |
| Core | Blessed Hammer | Damage |
| 1 | Falling Star | Arbiter trigger |
| 2 | Condemn | Vulnerable |
| 3 | Defiance Aura | Sustain |
| 4 | Fanaticism Aura | Attack Speed + Weaken |
| Ultimate | Arbiter of Justice | Transform |

---

## FAITH RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

### How Faith Works

- **Maximum Faith:** ~100 (base)
- **Blessed Hammer Cost:** ~30 Faith per cast
- **Faith Regen:** Slow passive + Basic Skill hits

### Faith Generation Methods

| Method | Faith Gained | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Advance** (hit enemy) | ~10-15 per hit | Primary generator |
| **Rally** | ~20-30 burst | Has life cost after Words of Sacrifice |
| Passive Regen | ~2-3 per second | Too slow to rely on |
| Gear affixes | Varies | Look for "Faith on Kill", "Faith per Second" |

### Rotation By Faith Level

| Faith % | What To Do |
|---------|------------|
| 75-100% | Blessed Hammer x3 |
| 50-75% | Blessed Hammer x1 → Advance x2 → Hammer x1 |
| 25-50% | Advance x3-4 → Hammer x1 |
| 0-25% | Rally (instant burst) → Advance spam |
| Empty | Rally → Advance until 50%+ |

### Common Faith Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Always empty | Not using Advance | Weave Advance between Hammers |
| Can't hit anything | Attacking at range | Get in MELEE range, Advance INTO enemies |
| Hammer doesn't cast | Not enough Faith | Rally for burst, then Advance |
| Running out mid-fight | Spamming Hammer only | 2 Advance : 1 Hammer ratio early game |

### Gear Affixes That Help (While Leveling)

Look for ANY of these on drops:
- Resource Cost Reduction
- Faith per Second
- Faith on Kill
- Core Skill Cost Reduction

|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Gloves** | Disciple/Judicator Damage | Attack Speed | Paladin Finesse | Worldly Finesse |
| **Pants** | Maximum Life | Armor | Worldly Endurance | Worldly Endurance |
| **Boots** | Movement Speed | Evade Grants MS | Natural Motion | Natural Motion |

### Unique Target Slots (Legendary Placeholder Tempers)

| Slot | Temper 1 | Temper 2 | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Helm** | Maximum Life | Armor | Replace with unique when found |
| **Chest** | Maximum Life | Armor | Replace with unique when found |

### Priority Tempers
1. **Blessed Hammer Double Damage** (Weapon) - until ~100% chance
2. **En Garde** (Shield) - until 100% Block Chance
3. **Arbiter Duration** - more uptime
4. **Disciple/Judicator Damage** - scaling
5. **Attack Speed** / **Cooldown Reduction** - QoL

### Temper Manual Reference

| Manual | Temper Options |
|--------|----------------|
| Paladin Finesse | Disciple Skill Damage, Judicator Skill Damage |
| Paladin Augments | Blessed Hammer Double Damage, Damage in Arbiter Form |
| Paladin Guard | En Garde Ranks, Arbiter Duration |
| Worldly Endurance | Maximum Life, Armor |
| Worldly Finesse | Attack Speed, Cooldown Reduction |

### Notes

- Judicator Damage for Judicator Oath, Disciple Damage for Disciple Oath
- Tempering low level gear is cheap and impactful while leveling

## MASTERWORKING PRIORITY

Focus 12/12 on these affixes (in order):

| 1 | Weapon | **Strength** or **Crit Damage** |

| 6 | Helm/Chest/Pants | **Armor** (for Castle scaling) |
| 7 | Boots | **Movement Speed** |

---

## PARAGON BOARDS

### Board Order

| # | Board | Glyph | Legendary Node | Why |
|---|-------|-------|----------------|-----|
| 1 | Starter | Spirit | - | Entry point, glyph socket |
| 2 | **Castle** | **Exploit** | **Castle (1.8% Armor = Damage)** | HIGHEST PRIORITY |
| 3 | Relentless | Challenger | Dervish (CDR while moving) | Always moving with Evade |
| 4 | Shield Bearer | Sentinel | Shield Bearer (Block = Damage) | Herald of Zakarum synergy |
| 5 | Beacon | Resplendence | Resplendent (Aura resets) | Sustains Rally HP cost |

### Glyph Priority (Level to 15 first, then 21)

| Priority | Glyph | Board | Effect |
|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Exploit** | Castle | Vulnerable damage - level to 15 FIRST |
| 2 | **Challenger** | Relentless | Damage while moving |
| 3 | Spirit | Starter | Core skill damage |
| 4 | Sentinel | Shield Bearer | DR when blocking |
| 5 | Resplendence | Beacon | Healing effectiveness |

### Board Pathing Strategy

**DO:**
- Rush to Legendary Node on each board
- Get Glyph socket immediately
- Grab Armor, Block Chance rare nodes on the path

**DON'T:**
- Fill entire boards with white nodes
- Skip glyph sockets
- Waste points on nodes that don't help the build

### Key Rare Nodes
- **Castle:** Ironclad, Stalwart, Pillars of Stability (Armor)
- **Relentless:** All CDR nodes
- **Shield Bearer:** Block Chance nodes, Armor nodes
- **Beacon:** Life nodes, Aura enhancement

## GAMEPLAY ROTATION

### Leveling (Pre-34)
```
1. Advance INTO enemy pack (generates Faith + damage)
2. Blessed Hammer x1-2 (don't empty Faith)
3. Advance x2-3 (refill Faith)
4. Blessed Hammer x1-2
5. Rally if low on Faith
6. Repeat
```

**Key Rule:** 2 Advance hits for every 1 Hammer cast early game

### Post-34 (With Exaltation)
```
1. Falling Star into pack (triggers Arbiter via Disciple)
2. Condemn (groups + Vulnerable)
3. Blessed Hammer x3 (they orbit you)
4. Rally for movement
5. Falling Star to next pack
6. Keep Auras active
```

### Endgame Speed Farming (With Argent Veil)
```
1. Falling Star into pack (triggers Arbiter)
2. Tap Blessed Hammer 3x (orbit you)
3. Evade constantly (Argent Veil spawns more hammers)
4. Move to next pack
5. Keep Defiance + Fanaticism Auras active
```

### Pit Pushing
```
1. Falling Star → Arbiter Form
2. Condemn to group enemies + Vulnerable
3. Blessed Hammer spam
4. Use Evade for repositioning + hammer spawns
5. Rally for resource if needed
```

### Boss Fights
```
1. Maintain Arbiter Form uptime (cycle cooldowns)
2. Stand close for hammer hits
3. Condemn for Vulnerable
4. Spam Blessed Hammer
5. Use Advance/Falling Star for dodging
```

---

## LEVELING STRATEGY

### Fastest Path
1. Complete Vessel of Hatred Campaign on Normal
2. Skip monsters, rush main objectives (massive XP spikes)
3. After campaign: Helltides + Tree of Whispers
4. Gathering Legion Events for bonus XP

### Gear Priority While Leveling
1. **Upgrade weapon constantly** (damage scales everything)
2. Don't hoard materials - temper leveling gear cheaply
3. Gamble at Curiosity Vendor: 1H Weapons > Chest > Pants > Boots > Rings

### Power Spike Levels
| Level | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| 15 | Oath unlocks - pick Disciple |
| 22 | Flash of the Blade - Advance triggers Arbiter |
| 34 | Exaltation Key Passive - damage spike |
| 50+ | Paragon unlocks - rush Castle board |
