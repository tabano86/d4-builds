## YOUR SKILL BAR

```
[Basic]  Rally          <- Now infinite use (Words of Sacrifice)
[Core]   Blessed Hammer <- Damage
[1]      Falling Star   <- Arbiter trigger + mobility
[2]      Condemn        <- Grouping + Vulnerable
[3]      Defiance Aura  <- Sustain
[4]      Fanaticism Aura <- Attack Speed + Weaken
[Ult]    Arbiter of Justice <- Transform (optional on bar)
```

## HOW TO PLAY

```
1. Falling Star into pack (Arbiter Form activates)
2. Condemn (groups enemies + Vulnerable)
3. Blessed Hammer x3 (they orbit you)
4. Rally for movement speed
5. Falling Star to next pack
6. Keep both Auras active at all times
```

### Arbiter Form
