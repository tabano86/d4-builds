## The Build in 30 Seconds

**Core Mechanic:** Argent Veil makes Evade spawn Blessed Hammers. Rally resets Evade cooldown. Result: Evade-Rally-Evade-Rally = infinite hammer tornado.

**Skill Bar:**
```
LMB: Rally (spam)
RMB: Arbiter of Justice (auto-triggers)
1: Falling Star (engage)
2: Condemn (pull + Vulnerable)
3: Defiance Aura (always on)
4: Fanaticism Aura (attack speed)
Space: EVADE (your main damage!)
```

**Rotation:**
```
Falling Star into pack -> Evade -> Rally -> Evade -> Rally -> repeat
```

## Paragon Path

```
1. Starter    -> Spirit glyph
2. Castle     -> Exploit glyph (PRIORITY - Armor = Damage)
3. Relentless -> Challenger glyph
4. Shield Bearer -> Sentinel glyph
5. Beacon     -> Resplendence glyph
```

## Required Uniques

1. **Argent Veil** (Ring) - Evade spawns hammers
2. **Herald's Morningstar** (Weapon) - +Hammer damage
3. **Herald of Zakarum** (Shield) - Doubles armor

## Common Problems

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No Faith | Use Advance between Hammers (early game) |
| Low damage | Get Argent Veil + Castle paragon board |
| Arbiter dropping | Stack CDR, temper Arbiter Duration on amulet |
| Dying | Keep Defiance Aura on, check armor |
